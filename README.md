This is a simple protein visualization web app. The intent of the project is not to be
production ready, but rather an educational exploration via building. The goals for
working on the project were:
- Brush up on React and Typescript
- Play around with something bio-related (thus Molstar)
- Learn about the latest frontend magic (Next.js)
- Play a bit with GraphQL (Apollo client to interact with PDB APIs)

Most things are rough around the edges, as all of this was done in a few
days of hacking.
